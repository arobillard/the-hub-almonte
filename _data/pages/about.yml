        The Hub is rooted in homegrown origins. In 1972, Neighbourhood Club
        member Mary Dugdale began to collect and give away clothing to anyone
        who was in need.

        In 1974, the CHEO Auxiliary began to look more closely into the needs of
        the Almonte community. The Neighbourhood Club and the Auxiliary merged
        together to form The Almonte Community Co-ordinators (ACC).

        The ACC was founded by women for women and their families. In May of
        1974, The ACC opened up The Hub, bringing with it a new force for social
        change in Almonte.

        The Hub and its sister store Rebound were created as second-hand stores
        which give their profits back into the community. Our main priority is
        to be a voice for the women and the most vulnerable in Almonte.

        The Hub has a very long history in downtown Almonte. It opened its doors
        at 66 Mill Street, and remained there until a devastating fire in 1997.
        In 1998, the Royal Bank of Canada sold us the The Hub’s current address,
        118 Mill Street, a beautiful historic building which was once The
        Orpheum Theatre, for $1.00.

        We have been proudly honoured numerous times by our community, for
        everything from our millions of dollars in donations, supporting more
        than 100 projects, programs, and causes, diverting an estimated 350
        tonnes of usable items from landfills, and using over 500,000 volunteer
        hours from over 500 people to benefit Almonte.

        We have managed to make headlines and always stay relevant in the
        Almonte news for our hard work. The strength of our organization has
        always been our members. Plenty of men and children have lent their
        helping hands, but women have always been the heart, soul, and face of
        The Hub.

        Currently we are renovating our 118 Mill Street location so it can
        perform double-duty with offices for social services delivery on an
        upper mezzanine, and 30% more retail display area on the main floor.
        We’re also adding communal and sorting areas, upgrading an accessible
        public bathroom, and ensuring a more barrier-free environment.

      Located in the heart of Almonte, The Hub is a not-for-profit retail store
      run by the Almonte Community Co-ordinators. Focused on supporting the
      community of Mississippi Mills since its inception in 1974, the Hub
      accepts donations of gently used family fashions, accessories, housewares,
      books, games and toys. These items are resold at the Hub, allowing the
      organization to support local charities.


      Annually, over $50,000 is donated towards hospice care, scholarships,
      health needs, sport teams, special events, Christmas baskets, Interval
      House, the Lanark County Food Bank and so much more.


      The Hub is operated by volunteers, and opens six days a week.
